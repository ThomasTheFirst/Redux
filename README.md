Redux
=====
This was developed to provide the client with a finished product in the event that we could not develop the project from scratch ourselves. It currently is not complete, but it has the functionality of editing, deleteing, creating and displaying everything from the database.

Required
========
Upload Image
Grid View
Page Links
Button Links
Amendment of Create/Display/Update pages to contain only editable/displayable fields
CSS layouting

... maybe other stuff that I am not presently aware of.

Installs
========
  -> In Package Manager Console type 'install-package EntityFramework -version 5.0.0'
  -> In Package Manager Console type 'install-package Newtonsoft.JSon'
